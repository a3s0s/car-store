# GitHub Upload Instructions - Alternative Method

## Issue Encountered
The `git push` command is encountering HTTP 400 errors, likely due to:
- Repository size (66MB with images)
- Network connectivity issues
- GitHub server temporary issues

## Alternative Upload Methods

### Method 1: Manual Upload via GitHub Web Interface

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/a3s0s/car-store
2. **Upload files manually**:
   - Click "uploading an existing file" or drag and drop
   - Upload all project files and folders
   - Commit the changes

### Method 2: Try Git Push Later
The git repository is properly configured. You can try pushing again later:

```bash
# Check if remote is configured
git remote -v

# Try pushing again
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Clone your repository: https://github.com/a3s0s/car-store.git
3. Copy all files to the cloned folder
4. Commit and push via GitHub Desktop

### Method 4: Compress and Upload
1. Create a ZIP file of the entire project
2. Go to your GitHub repository
3. Upload the ZIP file
4. Extract it in the repository
