# 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps - Fix Your 404 Error

## Current Status: 404 Error - App Not Starting

Your Railway deployment is showing a 404 error because the application isn't starting properly. Here are the **exact steps** you need to follow in your Railway dashboard:

## 🔧 Step 1: Check Railway Service Configuration

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)** and sign in
2. **Click on your car-store project**
3. **Click on your service** (the one that should be running your Flask app)

## ⚙️ Step 2: Configure Build and Start Commands

### In the "Settings" tab:

1. **Scroll down to "Build"** section:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Scroll down to "Deploy"** section:
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app`

## 🔑 Step 3: Set Environment Variables

### In the "Variables" tab, add these variables:

```
PORT=8000
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=car-store-secret-key-2024
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///car_store.db
PYTHONPATH=/app
```

**How to add variables:**
1. Click **"New Variable"**
2. Enter **Name** and **Value**
3. Click **"Add"**
4. Repeat for each variable

## 🔄 Step 4: Redeploy Your Application

1. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
2. **Click "Deploy Latest"** or **"Redeploy"**
3. **Wait for deployment to complete** (watch the logs)

## 📊 Step 5: Monitor Deployment Logs

### In the "Logs" tab, look for:

**✅ Success indicators:**
```
Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**❌ Error indicators:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError
ImportError
Port already in use
```

## 🧪 Step 6: Test Your Application

Once deployment is successful, test these URLs:

1. **Main App**: `https://car-store-production.up.railway.app/`
2. **Health Check**: `https://car-store-production.up.railway.app/health`
3. **Admin Panel**: `https://car-store-production.up.railway.app/admin/login`

## 🚨 If Still Not Working - Alternative Method

### Option A: Connect from GitHub

1. **Delete current service** in Railway
2. **Create new service** → **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Select your repository**: `a3s0s/car-store`
4. **Railway will auto-detect** the configuration files

### Option B: Manual Configuration

If auto-detection fails, manually set:

**Root Directory**: `/` (leave empty)
**Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
**Start Command**: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Ensure `requirements.txt` is in the root directory

### Issue 2: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Make sure `PORT` environment variable is set to `8000`

### Issue 3: Database errors
**Solution**: The app will create the database automatically on first run

### Issue 4: Import errors
**Solution**: Add `PYTHONPATH=/app` environment variable
